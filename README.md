## Description of the notebooks
> `Federated Learning.ipynb` - All data wrangling for the federated learning experiment reported on the paper. With 13 agents (data silos) comparing local trained models to federated learning using `FedAvg`.
> 
> `Centralized.ipynb` - Evaluation of naive scanning attack detection learning task centralizing all the data.
